About
=====

"YepMap" is a single file map service to convert addresses strings to coordinates (latitude and longitude) through Google Maps API version 3.
Draggable marker always shows right coordinates BUT only the closest addressable location obtained by Google Maps reverse geocoding. As seen in [Google Maps API, Reverse Geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/#ReverseGeocoding "Google Maps API, Reverse Geocoding"):
> Reverse geocoding is an estimate. The geocoder will attempt to find the closest addressable location within a certain tolerance; if no match is found, the geocoder will return zero results.
